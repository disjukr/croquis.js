## stroke protocol
brush-related functions in croquis.js are working on the [stroke protocol][stroke protocol].

stroke protocol consists of the `down` method and the `move` and `up` methods of the drawing context.

`down` method means that the stylus pen has started drawing a stroke. it returns the drawing context containing the `move` and `up` methods.

`move` means that the stylus pen draws a stroke, and `up` means that the stroke ends.

stroke protocol makes it easy to add features such as stabilization without having to modify the drawing code very much.

look at the [simple brush example][simple brush] and the [pulled string stabilizer example][pulled string].
you can see that the code is not different except for [the part injecting the settings][injecting the settings] and [the part drawing the guide][drawing the guide].
